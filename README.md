# Requirements
* Condensed package requirements are in `\requirements.txt`. If any dependency is missing, please contact mingxuan_cai@berkeley.edu.
* The non-standard packages you may need are tinycudann. See NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn for installation instructions. Depending on your system, you might just be able to do pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch, or might have to cmake and build it from source.
